<p> HELLO EVERYBODY, I AM</p>

<h1> Chandon  Dey </h1>

<h2> Software Developer </h2>

<p> I am a bachelor student pursing BS in computer engineering 
  from University of Cincinnati.  I am seeking opportunities to 
  further develop my skills and gain practical experience in software 
  development, computer engineering, or related fields. My academic coursework 
  and personal projects have equipped me with a solid foundation in programming 
  languages such as Javascript, HTML, CSS, React.js,
  Python, and C++, as well as experience with software 
  development tools and technologies. </p>
